[src-run] sublime-orton-package
==================================

CONTEXT:
    This message is displayed following an "INSTALL" action of this package.

DESCRIPTION:
    This Sublime Text 3 package provides a collection of Sublime Text 3 commands,
    key-bindings, and other utilities. While the contained functionality was
    created specifically to aid in the preferred development work-flow of those
    working at Source Consulting (src.run), you may too find the contained
    additions useful. Feel free to use at your own risk. :-)

FEATURES:
    - __Adjust font size of active view and global settings:__ Key-bindings to
      increase, decrease, and reset the font size of *only* the active view
      using `shift+ctrl++`, `shift+ctrl+-`, and `shift+ctrl+=`, respectively.
      Additionally, the normal, global font size adjustment key-bindings will
      continue to work, using `ctrl+=` and `ctrl+-` to increase or decrease the
      font size, though custom implementations have been substituted that
      utilize alternate size increment logic.
